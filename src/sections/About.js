        Hello! I'm Fady Morcos, a software engineer passionate about building
        efficient and impactful solutions. With a B.Eng. in Software Engineering
        from McMaster University and hands-on experience across various roles,
        Iâ€™ve honed my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies,
        including Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Evertz Microsystems, I contributed to media content workflows for
        major clients, focusing on automating processes, enhancing production
        systems, and delivering seamless media experiences. I also specialize in
        developing, annotating, and rating code across diverse languages for AI
        projects, allowing me to stay at the forefront of emerging AI and
        machine learning trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond technical work, I bring an entrepreneurial mindset, demonstrated
        by my venture, Desktop Doctor, where I managed end-to-end computer
        repair services and built a service-booking website from scratch. I
        thrive in collaborative settings and am driven by a genuine passion for
        creating solutions that make a difference. Let's connect and explore how
        I can contribute to impactful projects together!
