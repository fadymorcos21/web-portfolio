        Hello! I'm Fady Morcos, a McMaster Software Engineer passionate about
        building scalable, intuitive software solutions. I earned my B.Eng. in
        Software Engineering with co-op from McMaster University, where I honed
        skills in languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, alongside areas
        like machine learning, control systems, computer architecture, data
        sturctures and algorithms, advanced databases, and real-time systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I freelance as a Software Engineer, developing full-stack
        systems for clients across industries. I work closely with clients to
        deliver tailored solutions, using technologies such as React, Next.js,
        Tailwind, Node.js, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, MySQL, Google Cloud Platform,
        and Vercel. Recent projects include pharmacy web systems with integrated
        administrative dashboards, streamlining operations like prescription
        management and appointment scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to freelancing, I contribute to AI model training at
        DataAnnotation.tech, improving dataset quality through detailed code and
        data annotation work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, at Evertz Microsystems, I developed and optimized JavaScript
        and Python workflows for AMC Networks, helping automate media content
        processing and ensure seamless delivery to millions of viewers
        worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also carry an entrepreneurial spirit, demonstrated by launching
        Desktop Doctor â€” a computer and phone repair business for which I
        operated as a side hustle for some time. I also thrive in collaborative
        environments and am always excited to take on meaningful projects that
        create real impact.
