        Hello! I'm Fady Morcos, a McMaster Software Engineer passionate about
        building scalable, intuitive software solutions. I earned my B.Eng. in
        Software Engineering with co-op from McMaster University, where I honed
        skills in languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, alongside areas
        like machine learning, computer architecture, and real-time systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I freelance as a Software Engineer, developing full-stack
        systems for clients across industries. I work closely with clients to
        deliver tailored solutions, using technologies such as React, Next.js,
        Tailwind, Node.js, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, MySQL, Google Cloud Platform,
        and C#/.NET 8. Recent projects include pharmacy web systems with
        integrated admin dashboards, streamlining operations like prescription
        management and appointment scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to freelancing, I contribute to AI model training at
        DataAnnotation.tech, improving dataset quality through detailed code and
        data annotation work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, at Evertz Microsystems, I developed and optimized JavaScript
        and Python workflows for AMC Networks, helping automate media content
        processing and ensure seamless delivery to millions of viewers
        worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also carry an entrepreneurial spirit, demonstrated by launching
        Desktop Doctor â€” a service-booking platform for computer repairs. I
        thrive in collaborative environments and am always excited to take on
        meaningful projects that create real impact.
