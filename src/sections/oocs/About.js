        Hello! I'm Fady Morcos, a software engineer with a passion for crafting
        innovative, efficient, and impactful solutions. I hold a B.Eng. in
        Software Engineering from McMaster University and am actively building
        my skills through a variety of challenging projects and roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, I’ve been working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer and
        Independent Contractor in Ontario, where I’ve developed integrated
        pharmacy web systems featuring 20+ capabilities—streamlining
        prescription processing, appointment scheduling, and customer
        communication. This role has given me hands-on experience designing
        intuitive customer websites and dynamic administrative dashboards using
        modern technologies such as React, Node.js, Firebase, MySQL, Nodemailer,
        and Google Cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also contribute to enhancing software quality at DataAnnotation.tech,
        focusing on refining code across multiple languages and improving
        overall system performance. Previously, at Evertz Microsystems, I
        collaborated with teams to optimize media workflows and automate
        critical processing tasks, ensuring reliable and efficient service
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond these technical roles, I maintain an entrepreneurial
        mindset—demonstrated by my venture, Desktop Doctor, where I built a
        service-booking website and managed end-to-end computer repair services.
        I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to connect with
        others to create impactful digital solutions.
